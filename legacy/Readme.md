This folder stores Features of CEA that we no longer support.

1. Radiation_argis: it contains a series of scripts that would allow you to use the ArcGIS solar engine to calcualte solar
insolation for every hour of the year in buildings in CEA. It was great, but it did not consider reflections of the terrain
and it was quite slow. The feature was replaced for Radiation_Daysim, which is more powerful and detailed.

2. create_gml: it contans a series of functions that allow to translate CEA shapefiles into CityGML files. We had the thought on 
using CityGML as a main format for data exchange. But the format is just heavy and cumbersome to use for the moment.
